ASGI config for django_chat_app project.
ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, 
intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.

Where WSGI provided a standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides one for both asynchronous and synchronous apps, with a WSGI backwards-compatibility implementation and multiple servers and application frameworks.

It exposes the ASGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.
